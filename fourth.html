  <main><b>The Assignment4</b>
   <p>Welcome! </p>
   <p> <b>Main function introduction</b></p>
    <p> After user research and consultation, the product's functionality experienced a stumble.
      In order to reach more sustainable business goals and lasting development, the web design will focus on highlighting the two functional areas of collaboration and donations.
      There will be four functional areas in total.
      The first is the Donations section, which provides the most direct source of funding. This corresponds to a variety of payment methods, making it easier for users to pay. There are also past projects, allowing users to see where the funds are going.
      Secondly, there is the collaboration section, which offers both past events and the latest events. Past events can provide visibility and authenticity. The new activities are expected to enable two and more, allowing users to engage directly and be more selective.
      Further is the adoption section. It will solve the association's biggest overhead problem, increase the exposure of the animals and increase the chances of adoption.
      Finally, there is the About Us section, which will provide information about the association and increase authenticity and authority.
      <p> For more detail, you can see by  <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/AJlkOk9SourmU5GEbTKQzR/product2.0?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a></p> 
      
      <p> <b>Testing Section</b></p>
      <p> In the user testing section, I invited four University student who is members of the school's stray cat rescue club.</p>
      <img src="https://github.com/13829259650/Assignment-one-update/blob/main/dashboard.jpg?raw=true" height="300" />
      <p> And several questions were developed around.</p>
      <p>  Do people understand the services of the web?</p>
      <p>  Do people find it helpful?</p>
      <p>  Do people understand how to join the institution?</p>
      <p>  Do people believe the information?
        </p>
      
      <p> Specifically, I have set up five tasks for the user to perform.
        Suppose you want to find out some information about the Stray Animal Society on campus.
      <p> 1. Where would you find out details information about the Society? </p>
      <p> 2. What details of information will you get?</p>
      <p> 3. Find how to donate</p>
      <p> 4. How will you know what activities have be done?</p>
      <p> 5. How will you do to adopt the cat? 
        </p>

        <p> <b>Problems and Opportunities</b></p>
        <p> As for the bugs, the following are essential.
          <p> 1.It is difficult to jump to the home page from other pages, you need to click on the icon in the top left corner. Some users cannot find it</p>
          <p> 2. The information on the home page is not enough to support users to continue reading</p>
          <p> 3. Some users are confused about the icon categories on the home page</p>
          <p> 4. There is no way to participate in events, which does not attract more people to join</p>
          <p> 5. The payment methods for donations are not clear, so you don't know which one to use</p>
          <p> 6. the more news section is not attractive and does not reflect the strength of the association.</p>
          <p> 7. Not knowing the exact destination of the money.
          </p>
        <p> In terms of further improvements, several things can be done.
        <p> 1. Improve the content of the home page so that there is more information on the home page. Reflect the official nature and authority. </p>
        <p> 2. Reconsider the location where the home page function keys can appear, or refer to competing products to understand the common home page format. </p>
        <p> 3. Consider how to incorporate information about volunteers joining in the cooperation method. </p>
        <p> 4. Lay out more content in the collaborative approach; having only one activity will leave users with no choice. </p>
        <p> 5. Set up hyperlinks for jumping where appropriate. </p>
        <p> 6. Pay attention to the text within the circle on each page, this will play a vital role in leading. </p>
        <p> 7. Pay attention to the information on the buttons on each page, which should be jumpable and provide core functionality. </p>
        <p> 8. The icons on the home page need to be clearly used and distinguished from other functional areas such as the navigation bar. </p>
        <p> 9. Set up detail pages and registration pages in the event overview section, so that you can get a deeper understanding of the event and participate. </p>
        <p> 10. In the adoption function area, information about the adoption process needs to be added. </p>
        <p> 11. In the about us financial report area, specific project information can be set up so that donors can understand their funding curve and also have a more emotional temperature. </p>
        <p> 12. In the adoption information area, each button should lead to a detail page for the complete adoption process. </p>
        <p> 13. join us on the home page should link to a more direct how to join as a member, rather than the about us home page.
          </p>
