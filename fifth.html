    <b>The Assignment5</b>
    <p>Welcome! </p>
    <p>This is assignment5 page. The following will be updated according to the fruther study.</p>

    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <p>In Assignment 5, I managed to create a website that addresses the issue of stray animals within the university and publish it in a real environment. This was like a fulfilment of the promise I had made at the beginning and it was very exciting and rewarding.During the previous interviews, I realised that many university societies are very passionate about the issue of stray animals, but there are basically three challenges that they encounter. For the real web, you can click <a href="http://leeko.pythonanywhere.com/">here</a></p>

    <p><b>Funding issues (monetisation)</b></p>
    <p>Most of the directors and participants mentioned to me that stray animal rescue is like a bottomless pit and it is difficult to have sustainable and stable funding to keep it running. Most of the time it is internal members who make the donations. To address this issue, I first looked into the practices of competing and other established animal rescue organisations, and then adapted the payment methods for the mainland. Most mature NGOs use a form to make donations, with staff matching one-to-one and then completing the exact donation process, which adds credibility to the organisation. Secondly, NGOs in all countries accept bank card transfers, which is a more mature and traceable way of donating. However, during the interviews, I learnt that due to payment methods and students' behavioural preferences in the Mainland, most donations are made through WeChat and Alipay, so I also added the QR code payment function for donations. I hope that by diversifying and making donations more in line with users' habits, users will be prompted to donate and facilitate the act of donating.</p>

    <p><b>Cooperation issues</b></p>
    <p>It is difficult for rescue animals to survive on a single source of funding, so more and more established organisations are adopting a collaborative business approach. Examples include collaborating on events, generating co-branded events and relying on the animals' strengths for event planning. At the same time, there are more volunteers willing to get involved in events, learn about and become part of the organisation. I hope to be able to provide a pathway on the website for more willing partners to learn about the content and spawn a willingness to collaborate so that a partnership can be reached. The review of the activities and the introduction of the cooperation content can let the partners understand the organisation's proficiency in the cooperation process. It will also attract more volunteers to join us. This section will be highlighted on the home page and the about us page to strengthen the organisation's image in this area.</p>

    <p><b>Adoption issues</b></p>
    <p>The target users cite the low efficiency of adoption as the underlying reason for the difficulty in maintaining it. Once there are animals that have been relying on organised breeding for a long time, then a lot of money is needed. In order to get to the root of this problem, there needs to be greater exposure of adoptions. That's why I set up an adoption section. I wanted to show as many cats for adoption as possible, so that users would know more about the situation. The contact us logo is also visible everywhere, so that users can get information more quickly. If there is a strong desire to adopt, it will be easier for users to find us. In order to convince external funders that funds are being allocated effectively to address adoption and partnership activities, I have added financial reports to both about us and the home page to confirm the transparency and effectiveness of the organisation's finances.</p>

    <p><b>Data collection and content management</b></p>
    <p>I will focus on capturing contact forms from our database to learn about users and then filter and manage them. As most organisations have adopted SNS to aid communication and build user stickiness, I will select suitable users from the database to be diverted to SNS.</p>

    <p><b>Further improvement in final version</b></p>
    <p>Based on user testing, there are some areas of the site that need improvement.</p>
    <p>1. Add explanation of TRN meaning.</p>
    <p>2. Adjust the layout and section of the adoption area contact information.</p>
    <p>3. Adjusted the distinction between partners and volunteers in the partnership
      approach to give users a clearer idea of what to choose.</p>
    <p>4. Add jump links to both images and titles of events to better match user habits.</p>
    <p>5. Move donation methods up to make it easier for users to see the variety of ways
      to donate.</p>
    <p>6. Changing the code in the donation method to QRcode is clearer and mainland
      users are more willing to try it.</p>

    <p><b>Usability Tset</b></p>
    <p>I have designed five usability tasks to test the ease of use and fluency of the core functionality.
    1. where can you find out more details about the association?
    2. 2. How do you contact this NGO organisation?
    3. 3. If you are interested in the association and would like to make a donation, how would you do so?
    How will this be done?
    4. If you are interested in this association and would like to work with it, how will this be done?
    How will this be done?
    5. If you are interested in the association and would like to adopt, how would you do it?
  
    I also designed three post-test questions to get suggestions for improvement.
    1. please rate the whole process. 5 is very satisfactory and 1 is very unsatisfactory 
    2. 2. What difficulties did you encounter in the process?
    3. how do you think the page could be improved?</p>

    <p><b>ABtest</b></p>
    <p>To make the two features, adoption and collaboration, more visible, I made them on the scrolling images on the home page, forming buttons. However, I am not sure if horizontal or vertical buttons would make users more interested in which one to click first. Since visually users will view from left to right, top to bottom, I was puzzled as to whether this order of precedence would have an impact on the content.
    Secondly, the recurring question of trust, i.e. why should we trust our organisation, I decided to test whether financial reports were attractive to users, so I added financial reports to the homepage in the variables.
